# Sending Real-Time Tick Data and Sales Information from Sierra Chart to a Python Client using ZeroMQ

In this beginner-friendly tutorial, we will show you how to send real-time tick data and sales information from a Sierra Chart indicator to a Python client on a different computer using ZeroMQ. We will cover the necessary C++ code for the Sierra Chart indicator and the Python code for the client running on Linux. 

## Prerequisites

You need to have Sierra Chart installed on a Windows computer and Python 3 installed on a Linux computer.

## Step 1: Setting up ZeroMQ on the Windows Sierra Chart computer

1. Download the precompiled ZeroMQ library for Windows from the official website: https://zeromq.org/download/. Choose the appropriate version based on your computer architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).

2. Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to the `lib` folder. Copy the `libzmq-v***-mt-**_**_**.dll` file (the file name will depend on the ZeroMQ version and architecture) and paste it into the Sierra Chart installation folder (usually `C:\SierraChart`).

3. Go to the `include` folder of the unzipped ZeroMQ files and copy the entire `zmq.hpp` file. Paste it into the `ACS_Source` folder within your Sierra Chart installation directory (usually `C:\SierraChart\ACS_Source`).

## Step 2: Setting up ZeroMQ on the Linux Python client computer

1. Open a terminal window and install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip3 install pyzmq
   ```

## Step 3: Creating the Sierra Chart custom study with ZeroMQ

1. Open Sierra Chart, and from the top menu, go to "Analysis" > "Studies."

2. In the "Studies" window, click on "Add Custom Study," then "New" to create a new custom study.

3. In the "New Study" window, give the custom study a name, such as "ZeroMQTickData."

4. Click on the "Edit Source" button to open the ACS_Source folder. Create a new C++ file named `ZeroMQTickData.cpp`.

5. Open `ZeroMQTickData.cpp` in your favorite C++ editor and copy the following code:

   ```cpp
   #include "sierrachart.h"
   #include "zmq.hpp"

   #pragma comment(lib, "libzmq-v***-mt-**_**_**.lib") // Replace with the correct filename

   SCDLLName("ZeroMQ Tick Data")

   SCStudyInterfaceVersion(1)

   zmq::context_t context(1);
   zmq::socket_t publisher(context, ZMQ_PUB);

   SCFunction SCZeroMQTickData(SCStudyGraphRef sc) {
       if (sc.SetDefaults) {
           sc.GraphName = "ZeroMQ Tick Data";
           sc.StudyDescription = "Sends tick data and sales information to a Python client.";
           sc.AutoLoop = 1;
           return;
       }

       int endpoint_bind = publisher.bind("tcp://*:5555");

       if (endpoint_bind == 0) {
           sc.AddMessageToLog("Successfully bound to tcp://*:5555", 1);
       } else {
           sc.AddMessageToLog("Failed to bind to tcp://*:5555", 1);
           return;
       }

       SCString tick_data;
       tick_data.Format("%s,%.6f,%.6f,%.6f,%.6f,%lld", sc.Symbol.GetChars(),
                        sc.BaseDateTimeIn[sc.Index].ToDouble(),
                        sc.High[sc.Index],
                        sc.Low[sc
   ```
---
continue
---
   ```cpp
       Index],
                        sc.Close[sc.Index],
                        sc.Volume[sc.Index]);

       zmq::message_t message(tick_data.GetLength());
       memcpy(message.data(), tick_data.GetChars(), tick_data.GetLength());

       publisher.send(message);

       sc.AddMessageToLog("Sent tick data: " + tick_data, 0);
   }
   ```

6. Replace the `#pragma comment(lib, "libzmq-v***-mt-**_**_**.lib")` line with the correct filename of the `.dll` file you copied to the Sierra Chart installation folder in Step 1.

7. Save the file and close the editor.

8. Go back to the "New Study" window in Sierra Chart and click on "Build." If the build is successful, you should see a "Build succeeded" message.

9. Close the "New Study" window and add the "ZeroMQ Tick Data" custom study to your chart.

## Step 4: Creating the Python client on the Linux computer

1. Create a new Python file named `sierra_chart_client.py` on your Linux computer.

2. Open `sierra_chart_client.py` in your favorite Python editor and copy the following code:

   ```python
   import zmq

   context = zmq.Context()

   print("Connecting to Sierra Chart server...")
   socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
   socket.connect("tcp://<IP_ADDRESS>:5555")  # Replace <IP_ADDRESS> with the IP address of the Windows computer running Sierra Chart

   socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "")

   while True:
       tick_data = socket.recv_string()
       print("Received tick data:", tick_data)

       # Process the tick data as needed
   ```

3. Replace `<IP_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of the Windows computer running Sierra Chart.

4. Save the file and close the editor.

## Step 5: Running the Python client

1. Open a terminal window on your Linux computer.

2. Run the Python client by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 sierra_chart_client.py
   ```

3. You should start receiving real-time tick data and sales information from the Sierra Chart indicator. The tick data will be printed in the terminal window.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up real-time tick data and sales information communication between a Sierra Chart indicator and a Python client using ZeroMQ. You can now use this data for further processing and analysis as needed.

explain how to dynamically resolve the windows computer's ip adress from the linux computer.  rewrite the python script with the zeromq code so that the windows computer's ip address is dynamically resolved
---
To dynamically resolve the Windows computer's IP address from the Linux computer, you can use the Python `socket` library to perform hostname resolution. First, you need to know the hostname of the Windows computer. 

1. On the Windows computer, open a Command Prompt and type `hostname`. Press Enter to get the hostname.

2. Update the Python script `sierra_chart_client.py` as follows:

```python
import socket as pysocket
import zmq

def resolve_hostname(hostname):
    try:
        return pysocket.gethostbyname(hostname)
    except pysocket.error:
        print(f"Failed to resolve hostname: {hostname}")
        return None

context = zmq.Context()

windows_hostname = "your_windows_hostname"  # Replace with your Windows computer's hostname

ip_address = resolve_hostname(windows_hostname)

if ip_address is None:
    print("Unable to resolve IP address. Exiting...")
    exit(1)

print(f"Connecting to Sierra Chart server at {ip_address}...")
zmq_socket = context.socket(zmq.SUB)
zmq_socket.connect(f"tcp://{ip_address}:5555")

zmq_socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, "")

while True:
    tick_data = zmq_socket.recv_string()
    print("Received tick data:", tick_data)

    # Process the tick data as needed
```

3. Replace `your_windows_hostname` with the hostname of your Windows computer that you obtained in step 1.

Now, when you run the updated `sierra_chart_client.py` script, it will first try to resolve the IP address of the Windows computer using its hostname. If the resolution is successful, the script will connect to the Sierra Chart server using the resolved IP address.

Keep in mind that this approach requires that the Linux and Windows computers are in the same local network and the hostname is resolvable. If you encounter issues with hostname resolution, make sure that there are no firewall or network restrictions preventing the resolution process.

To set or change the hostname on a Windows 10 computer, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the **Start** button (the Windows logo located in the bottom-left corner of your screen) and select **System** from the context menu.

2. In the **System** window, under the **Related settings** section, click on the **Advanced system settings** link.

3. In the **System Properties** window, go to the **Computer Name** tab.

4. Click on the **Change** button.

5. In the **Computer Name/Domain Changes** window, you will see the current computer name in the **Computer name** field. To change it, enter a new name in this field.

6. Click on the **OK** button to apply the changes.

7. A prompt will appear, informing you that you need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Click on **OK**.

8. Close the **System Properties** window and click on **Restart Now** in the **System Settings Change** prompt to restart your computer.

After the computer restarts, the new hostname will be in effect. You can verify the change by opening a Command Prompt and typing `hostname`. Press Enter, and the new hostname should be displayed.

Please note that changing the hostname may affect other services and applications on your computer that rely on the old hostname. Make sure to update any relevant settings and configurations to avoid potential issues.

To allow the Python script to connect to the Sierra Chart server running on the Windows computer, you may need to create a new inbound rule in the Windows Firewall to permit incoming traffic on the port used by the server (in our example, port 5555).

Follow these steps to create a new inbound rule in the Windows Firewall:

1. Press `Win + R` on your keyboard to open the **Run** dialog. Type `wf.msc` and press Enter to open the **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** console.

2. In the left pane, click on **Inbound Rules**.

3. In the right pane, click on **New Rule** to open the **New Inbound Rule Wizard**.

4. Select **Port** as the rule type and click **Next**.

5. Choose **TCP** as the protocol type. In the **Specific local ports** field, enter `5555` (or the port number you are using for the Sierra Chart server). Click **Next**.

6. Select **Allow the connection** and click **Next**.

7. Check the network profiles (Domain, Private, and Public) for which you want the rule to apply. Click **Next**.

8. Provide a name for the new rule, such as "Sierra Chart Server." Optionally, you can add a description. Click **Finish** to create the rule.

Now the Windows Firewall should allow incoming connections to the Sierra Chart server on the specified port. The Python script running on the Linux computer should be able to connect without any issues. If you still encounter connectivity problems, double-check the IP address and hostname configurations, and ensure there are no additional firewalls or security software blocking the connection.
